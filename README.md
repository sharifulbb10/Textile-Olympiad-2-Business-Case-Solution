# Textile-Olympiad-2-Business-Case-Solution
We attended in Textile Olympiad Business Case Competition
and attained a competitive position there with the other
competitors. I feel proud to play the role of the leader
of that team. My teammates were Morshed John (student of
Apparel Engineering Department, DWMTEC) and Mollika Barman
(student of Apparel Engineering Department, DWMTEC).
